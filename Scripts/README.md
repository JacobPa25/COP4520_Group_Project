## Python scripts for displaying frame data

A script for each example we made with multiple functions for the different graph types:

- Line Graph to show the fps over time of the Single vs. Multi Threaded codes.
- Best Fit adds a best fit line to the plots of each data set to better show their difference.
- Bar Graph compares the average fps of the two.
